Boost (libboost-dev), ncurses (libncurses-dev).

"make" creates an executable file called "bastet", that's all you need to run the program. 
Optionally, for system-wide high scores, you may want to create an empty "/var/games/bastet.scores2" file, and make sure that is writable to the bastet executable.

Simplest way to create system-wide high scores under any Linux distro that has a "games" groups:

cd the-directory-in-which-you-found-this-file
make
cp bastet /usr/local/bin
chgrp games /usr/local/bin/bastet
chmod g+s /usr/local/bin/bastet
touch /var/games/bastet.scores2
chgrp games /var/games/bastet.scores2
chmod 664 /var/games/bastet.scores2
