Boost (libboost-dev + libboost-program-options-dev), ncurses (libncurses-dev).

"make" creates an executable file called "bastet", that's all you need to run the program. 
Optionally, for system-wide high scores, you may want to create an empty "/var/games/bastet.scores2" file, and make sure that is writable to the bastet executable.

Simplest way to create system-wide high scores under any Linux distro that has a "games" groups:

cd the-directory-in-which-you-found-this-file
make
cp bastet /usr/local/bin
chgrp games /usr/local/bin/bastet
chmod g+s /usr/local/bin/bastet
touch /var/games/bastet.scores2
chgrp games /var/games/bastet.scores2
chmod 664 /var/games/bastet.scores2


"translations.sh" is a script that iterates an array with the translated languages ​​and in each iteration generates the .mo binary file and copy this into the folder /usr/share/locale/xx_XX/LC_MESSAGES/, where xx_XX is the language in which It was translated.

To change the language of the game,from the console change the value of LANGUAGE for example:

LANGUAGE=es_AR
