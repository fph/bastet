==How to make translation files==

To add translations in other language you need to create a new PO file in the language you want (This file must be saved inside po/pt_BR),
for example to add Portuguese translations from the terminal you must execute the following command: 

  `msginit -l pt_PT -o main.po -i main.pot`

It first ask for the email of the translator and next generates a file for language chose  (here pt_PT)
```
 Is the following your email address?

f.poloni_at_gmx.com

 Please confirm by pressing Return, or enter your email address.
```
In the header of the new file you can see all the information related to the selected languague and all msgid (Message Identifier) generated from POT file

```
"Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2018-05-02 18:18-0300\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: 2018-05-30 19:33-0300\n"
"Last-Translator: Bastet <f.poloni_at_gmx.com>\n"
"Language-Team: Portuguese\n"
"Language: pt\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);\n"

#: main.cpp:47
msgid "Customize keys"
msgstr ""

#: main.cpp:47
msgid "Quit"
msgstr ""
```
Now all you have to do is add the translations in each msgstr 
```
#: main.cpp:47
msgid "Customize keys"
msgstr "Personalizar as chaves"

#: main.cpp:47
msgid "Quit"
msgstr "Sair"

Finally, add the language that you translated in the array of languages ​​declared in the translations.sh script.
