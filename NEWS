==0.43==
Complete code rewrite. As I go on trying to grok C++, algorithms and data
structures, and as I started to understand more of Peter's code, I found 
it useful to rewrite all this stuff from scratch.
This should solve some issues and probably introduce new ones. Therefore this
version needs a lot of playtesting and bug-hunting.
The algorithm has been split into two, one with the next block preview (normal)
and one without (harder).
New and more sophisticated techniques are now used to write the  block-choosing
algorithms, which should not be fooled as easily as before.
 
==0.41==
Features a brand-new AI, which should provide a much less boring gameplay
and avoid some bugs of the previous one. I have not done any work on the 
interface since my primary goal is having a good algorithm, and not the 
eye-candy. This new version somehow avoids the endless queues of the same
block you saw in 0.37: unfortunately, this makes the game a bit easier
(now you can do five lines with much less effort). If you do not like 
the thing, you can tweak the figures at the bottom of bast.c, which should 
look like this:
      const int bl_percent[BLOCK_TYPES]={75,92,98,100,100,100,100};
that is: 75% chance you will get the worst brick, 92-75% for the second one
and so on (no chance to get the best three bricks).
Editing to 85,95,100,100,100,100,100 will considerably increase the difficulty
of the game (TODO: some better way to choose this...). 
Moreover, the old 0.37 algorithm can be compiled in (instead of the new one) 
by simply renaming bast-old.c to bast.c

First public release, created by modifying Petris by Peter Seidler.
